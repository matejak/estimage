# estimage
3-point task estimation app

## Features

- As a sysadmin, I want to be able to set up Estimage to connect to various task systems, so my customers will be able to estimate on the top of those systems using Estimage, while being backwards-compatible.
- As a developer, I want to
  - estimate tasks using the 3-point method without interfering with others.
  - export results of my estimations to the main task database, so my estimations can be used by the whole team.
  - see similar tasks when estimating, so I get feedback that can improve my relative estimation.
  - nominate a set of estimations as globally authoritative, so I have access to working versions of 3-point estimates at any time.
  - keep track of history of the authoritative estimation, so reestimates are easily identifiable, and not hidden.
  - work with my estimation and the authoritative estimation if it exists, or at least with a marked estimation as its fallback.
  - express interest on working on an issue or epic, and to review this information, so that I can manage my focus, and I can help others to plan in a way that can consider my contribution preferences.
- As a stakeholder, I want to
  - see the team's burndown charts and velocity charts, so that I know whether the team is in control of things.
  - have projection of the state of things readily available, so that I can correlate it with the team's version and focus on potential differences.
  - identify tasks or epics that are in danger of slipping, so that I can realocate resources in time.
